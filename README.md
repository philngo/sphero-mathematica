# Sphero/Mathematica Connection

## Connect to a [Sphero](http://www.gosphero.com/) robot (Orbotix) from within Mathematica

The sample notebook explains how to connect and gives some fun examples. This
package allows you to control Sphero using Mathematica's powerful built-in
interface for dynamic control.

What you might want to do with this package:
    - Change Sphero's color, heading and speed.
    - Access Sphero's built-in gyrometer and accelerometer.
    - Write custom scripts.
    - Use Sphero to dynamically control Graphics3D objects (my personal favorite).

Enjoy!
